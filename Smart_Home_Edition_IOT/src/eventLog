##EVENTlog
##THIS IS THE EVENT LOG. YOU CAN INPUT USER AND GATEWAY EVENT TO THIS LOG AND YOUR SYSTEM WILL FUNCTION ACCORDINGLY. 
##IT SHOULD BE SURROUNDED BY START AND STOP AND SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS. 

### USER: ENTER and EXIT is for "testing" if the gateway properly predicts the sensor activity 
   

START

GATEWAY:QUERY DOOR STATE
USER:DOOR OPEN PS
USER:BULB ON
USER:MOTION ACTIVE
GATEWAY:QUERY TEMPERATURE
USER:MOTION ACTIVE
ATEWAY:QUERY MOTION STATE
USER:DOOR OPEN PS
USER:DOOR OPEN
STOP




##### Case for just testing User entry/exit proper detection with the program
#START

#USER:OUTLET OFF
#USER:ENTER
#GATEWAY:QUERY TEMPERATURE
#USER:EXIT
#STOP
